# Progressive Enchantments Mod
Makes higher level enchantments only available through performing specific actions.
## Base game changes
- when using an anvil, new and combined enchantments, always result
in a level 1 enchantment - affectAnvil,
- when using the enchanting table, the resulting enchantments are always level 1 - affectEnchantingTable,
- villagers always sell level 1 enchantments. This is done to reduce the cost of enchanted books,
which would have the price of a higher level book, even though the resulting enchantment would be 1, 
when used in an anvil - affectVillagerTrading,

Enchanted items and books found through other means are left unchanged. 
The above changes can be turned off in the config.

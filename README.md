# Progressive Enchantments Mod
This mod changes how increasing the power, of some non treasure enchantments, works.
It aims to create a better progression curve to enchantments, not just buying a better one.
Enchantments will have a specific task assigned to them, executing that task will count towards unlocking a new level.
Some enchantments are excluded, because their function does not translate to a task smoothly.
Enchantments have a varied amount of task point assigned to them, for example:
you need to kill multiple mobs with one shot a few times for the enchantment to upgrade,
but you need to mine a lot of block to get an upgrade.
All enchantments, affected by this mod, have their maximum upgrade tier doubled.

## Obtaining enchantments
Enchantments affected by this mod will be available from normal sources 
(enchanting table, chest, villager trades), but only at level 1. Note that equipment with
enchantment already present will still spawn in chest or on monsters normally. 

## Upgrading and downgrading
Enchantment will be highlighted if they are ready to be upgraded, to upgrade an enchantment
you will need another copy of the enchantment on a book. Combining the enchanted item and
the book will result in an upgrade. This process can be reversed by combining an enchanted item,
containing an enchantment which is not ready to upgrade, and a book, with the enchantment you want
to downgrade.

## Progressing towards upgrading
The progression is going to be left to chance. Every time you perform a task the game
will check if it will upgrade the enchantment. The chance gets progressively lower
the higher you enchantment level is. There will be a system to ensure that you will
upgrade the enchantment eventually. It will raise the chance to upgrade if the last 
attempt was not successful.
